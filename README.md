## Week 8 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Desctription

This project was created to exhibit functional use of MySQL and MySQL workbench to create my own database that I used to catalog European whisky distilleries. The application supports each of the CRUD operations by using EntityManagers as opposed to manual entry of SQL statements. 

### How to Use

The user will start at the homepage of my app, where each of the distilleries are listed off as buttons tht will take them to informative pages that describe the type/location of each individual distillery. Upon navigation to the page, the user will be able to easily edit the information that is pre-populated to text boxes or delete the entry alltogether.

Additionally, the user can add a distillery from the homepage so that they can customize it to their liking.
